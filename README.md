# CRUD on MySQL database with Java
    Application that has been developed to manipulated BrazilDB.
    The database has two tables "estado" and "cidade". ("State" and "City").

    The implementation of Swing allows the user to interact with a Graphical user interface.
    Through this interface the user can choose to manipulate the city or state table
    by using the following functions:
        Create, list, update and delete.

    Note: In order to insert an city in the database, a state id must be referred. 
    That implies in the creation of a state before an city.
    Note: There's also the function "exit", that closes the application.

    At the main menu, the user can choose which function he wants to execute.
